## PandaJS
**Ease of Use**

Uses HTML5 game engine. Variety of features are supported like Physics engine, Sound support, modules, timer etc.

**Documentation**

Has a dedicated page for Documentation where we can find sample codes for all scenarios. Cannot find much YouTube videos which could have helped us understanding development more.
[PandaJS Docs](http://www.pandajs.net/docs/)

**Community**
Has an active community where a lot of people seems actively helping out in issues. We can go through already solved issues to understand scenarios better.
[Panda Community](http://www.html5gamedevs.com/forum/19-pandajs/)

**Overall**
Seems like an active community but other technologies seems to be more widely used. Since no YouTube videos are available, we may experience difficulties.

## KiwiJS
**Ease of Use**

KiwiJS is an open source HTML5 framework. Will need same efforts as for PandaJS.

**Documentation**

Supports a lot of API which can be easily found on their website.
[APIs](http://www.kiwijs.org/api/)
Tutorials are also available on their website which can be used to get started.

**Community**

No dedicated page found for discussions on issues. Website has comments section where people discuss their issues.

**Overall**

Same as PandaJS. Not much found on YouTube.


# Ankit

## pixi.js

**********Ease of Use**********
* pixi.js is a lightweight 2D library that works across all devices. It is very fast as compared to other libraries.
* It uses WebGL renderer on browsers that support it. If the browser doesn’t support it, it will automatically fall back to canvas renderer.
* Doesn’t need prior knowledge of WebGL to use this library.
* Doesn’t have to worry about cross platform compatibility and low level code as it is handled by the library itself and it provides its own simple and powerful APIs for us.

**********Documentation**********
* It provides a detailed API documentation for us.
* It also provides plenty of examples for our references.

**********Community**********
* It has a very active repository on GitHub with around 15k stars.
* It also provides a forum to discuss solutions.
* It also provides Slack channel for discussion.

## melonJS

**********Ease of Use**********
* It is a lightweight 2D sprite-based engine which natively integrates Tiled Map Editor.
* It is a WebGL renderer only, so won’t work on browsers which do not support WebGL.

**********Documentation**********
* It provides a well structured documentation.
* There are 2 sample tutorials available on the site to understand the basics, apart from that there aren’t that many examples where we can look for reference.

**********Community**********
* It does not have much popular and active GitHub repository when compared to other libraries available for game development.
* Although, it provides a forum for discussions.


# Palash

## Phaser

**********Ease of Use**********
* 2-D gaming engine 
* Language – Javascript 
* Free and open source 
* Game Engines - Input support, Graphics, Sound
* Coding is pretty much average and not that tough, simple 2-d games can be created with available resources

**********Documentation**********
* Document is good, but will not rate very high, we will have to search for other sources as well to get the job done. Rate - 3/5

**********Community**********
* Twitter
* Slack
* Discord

## Easel JS ( Create JS )

**********Ease of Use********** 
* Seemed comparatively easy to Phaser engine. 
* Language is JS along with some events as we had in Java Applets 
* Similar to what we can develop with Phaser but with some less code.

***********Documentation*********** 
* Good documentation – 3.5/5 
* Couple of Youtube videos

***********Community*********** 
* For Games – HTML5 Game Devs is extremely active 
* But for Easel JS, I was not able to find a good community focusing on the same, HTML5 Game Dev’s doesn’t specifically focus on Easel
