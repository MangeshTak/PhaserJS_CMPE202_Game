## PandaJS
**Ease of Use**

Uses HTML5 game engine. Variety of features are supported like Physics engine, Sound support, modules, timer etc.

**Documentation**

Has a dedicated page for Documentation where we can find sample codes for all scenarios. Cannot find much YouTube videos which could have helped us understanding development more.
[PandaJS Docs](http://www.pandajs.net/docs/)

**Community**
Has an active community where a lot of people seems actively helping out in issues. We can go through already solved issues to understand scenarios better.
[Panda Community](http://www.html5gamedevs.com/forum/19-pandajs/)

**Overall**
Seems like an active community but other technologies seems to be more widely used. Since no YouTube videos are available, we may experience difficulties.

## KiwiJS
**Ease of Use**

KiwiJS is an open source HTML5 framework. Will need same efforts as for PandaJS.

**Documentation**

Supports a lot of API which can be easily found on their website.
[APIs](http://www.kiwijs.org/api/)
Tutorials are also available on their website which can be used to get started.

**Community**

No dedicated page found for discussions on issues. Website has comments section where people discuss their issues.

**Overall**

Same as PandaJS. Not much found on YouTube.


# Ankit

## pixi.js

**********Ease of Use**********
* pixi.js is a lightweight 2D library that works across all devices. It is very fast as compared to other libraries.
* It uses WebGL renderer on browsers that support it. If the browser doesn’t support it, it will automatically fall back to canvas renderer.
* Doesn’t need prior knowledge of WebGL to use this library.
* Doesn’t have to worry about cross platform compatibility and low level code as it is handled by the library itself and it provides its own simple and powerful APIs for us.

**********Documentation**********
* It provides a detailed API documentation for us.
* It also provides plenty of examples for our references.

**********Community**********
* It has a very active repository on GitHub with around 15k stars.
* It also provides a forum to discuss solutions.
* It also provides Slack channel for discussion.

## melonJS

**********Ease of Use**********
* It is a lightweight 2D sprite-based engine which natively integrates Tiled Map Editor.
* It is a WebGL renderer only, so won’t work on browsers which do not support WebGL.

**********Documentation**********
* It provides a well structured documentation.
* There are 2 sample tutorials available on the site to understand the basics, apart from that there aren’t that many examples where we can look for reference.

**********Community**********
* It does not have much popular and active GitHub repository when compared to other libraries available for game development.
* Although, it provides a forum for discussions.


# Palash

## Phaser

**********Ease of Use**********
* 2-D gaming engine 
* Language – Javascript 
* Free and open source 
* Game Engines - Input support, Graphics, Sound
* Coding is pretty much average and not that tough, simple 2-d games can be created with available resources

**********Documentation**********
* Document is good, but will not rate very high, we will have to search for other sources as well to get the job done. Rate - 3/5

**********Community**********
* Twitter
* Slack
* Discord

## Easel JS ( Create JS )

**********Ease of Use********** 
* Seemed comparatively easy to Phaser engine. 
* Language is JS along with some events as we had in Java Applets 
* Similar to what we can develop with Phaser but with some less code.

***********Documentation*********** 
* Good documentation – 3.5/5 
* Couple of Youtube videos

***********Community*********** 
* For Games – HTML5 Game Devs is extremely active 
* But for Easel JS, I was not able to find a good community focusing on the same, HTML5 Game Dev’s doesn’t specifically focus on Easel

## Unity
**Ease of Use**

You will need to get familiar with Unity and C#. C# is easy to pick up especially if you already know Java. It may take some time to begin with, but once you get used to Unity and C#, it will be easy to find what you want and how to do it.
Unity also has an asset store, there are many free assets or very low cost assets we can use. This will save us a lot of time in making figures, objects and scenes.

**Documentation**

Well written, very detailed
https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/index.html


**Community**

Lots of questions and answers can be found on
https://unity3d.com/community

**Overall**

Plenty of tutorials can be found on YouTube, search "unity tutorial 2d" will return 500k+ videos.
Unity is made specifically for creating games. Therefore we can do almost anything we want in the game. 

## LycheeJS
**No longer active**

## ThreeJS
**Overall**

It seems like this library is mostly for 3D graphics and animations. There are a ton of plugins that make game creation easier, but not super easy to pick up. Development is still active and code is super light weight. Probably not the easiest first step into web game development.

**Ease of Use**

For setting up visuals and scenes it seems very simple. Lots of plugins to choose from to easily create something simple right away. For creating something more complex it might require more than just a skim of the documentations. There are lots of examples for fun simple games with very little code.

**Documentation**

The documentation is great for creating graphics and animations. Lots of online guides on how to use it and create games, it seems a bit more involved though. Overall, great.

**Community**

Again, lots and lots of plugins. three.js seems widely used and there is a very large community. Many great examples and use cases online as well.
