## PandaJS
**Ease of Use**

Uses HTML5 game engine. Variety of features are supported like Physics engine, Sound support, modules, timer etc.

**Documentation**

Has a dedicated page for Documentation where we can find sample codes for all scenarios. Cannot find much YouTube videos which could have helped us understanding development more.
[PandaJS Docs](http://www.pandajs.net/docs/)

**Community**
Has an active community where a lot of people seems actively helping out in issues. We can go through already solved issues to understand scenarios better.
[Panda Community](http://www.html5gamedevs.com/forum/19-pandajs/)

**Overall**
Seems like an active community but other technologies seems to be more widely used. Since no YouTube videos are available, we may experience difficulties.

## KiwiJS
**Ease of Use**

KiwiJS is an open source HTML5 framework. Will need same efforts as for PandaJS.

**Documentation**

Supports a lot of API which can be easily found on their website.
[APIs](http://www.kiwijs.org/api/)
Tutorials are also available on their website which can be used to get started.

**Community**

No dedicated page found for discussions on issues. Website has comments section where people discuss their issues.

**Overall**

Same as PandaJS. Not much found on YouTube.
