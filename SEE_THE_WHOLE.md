# See The Whole

## Week 1
Seeing the whole is all about having the team recognize the big picture. Being able to work on small parts, yet realizing the value of that part to the rest of the project, is an essential skill for everyone on the team to have. Since we haven't written any code or implemented any design yet, it is much easier to see the whole.

We started with splitting up the research, each looking into a few libraries and tools required for the project, then coming together to discuss the pros and cons of each. This will allow us to discuss which tools we'd like to use, and the impact a choice of one particular tool can have on our product. This approach is inline with this value as it allows us to see the various choices we have.

Another example of us seeing the whole is our dedication to the Agile process. The focus of this assignment is to practice Agile and Design Patterns. We've spent alot of time this week discussing and agreeing on the workflow that we will use.

## Week 2
This week, we battled with ideas discussed and details about the project. Our discussions focused on what would be included in the game, what languages, frameworks, and tools we would use for the project. More importantly, we focused on how each choice would effect the long term. We elaborated on our ideas and determined the estimated time and effort it would take to implement each idea. Overall, we did a good job at seeing the whole while putting a magnifying glass on the project.

## Week 3
To really see the whole, the team must understand atleast at a high level, what tooling revolves around creating the project. We dedicated this week to learning PhaserJS as it will be our main tool for developing the game. We've also split up and assigned expertise: Graphics, UI, Music, Architecture, and Concept. This will help us come together and share our knowledge so that we can all have a better idea of how to carry this game from idea to reality.

## Week 4
After all the work to explore the various aspects of creating a web game, we've finally started creating code. We've learned how important it is to get a better sense of the big picture and scope of the project before starting to implement the little details. The results should be more scalable with less code debt.

## Week 5
This week we had great demos of the working pieces of the game. We each took turn demo-ing the various aspects of the game we worked on. We saw how to move the character around, how to interact with objects, how to create the map, and how to interact with enemies. We also got an overview of the overall app with the API's between each piece. The purpose of all this is to make sure that every member of the team understands the whole game, rather than just the bit they worked on. In the coming week, we will focus on establishing concrete APIs so that each piece can be developed individually while still being able to easily integrate together.

## Week 6
We created our first draft of the class diagram which helps to solidify the architecture of the game. Being able to draw out the diagrams and API's helped us split up the work among ourselves. In the following weeks, we will put all of our learnings together and finalize the game. We were only able to draw this big picture by coming together with the pieces and sharing our individual knowledge.

## Week 7
This week we came together to integrate the various pieces we've individually worked on. The hardest part about integration is that everyone must know how to connect their working part with the rest of the application. This requires everyone to know what data is available to their components. We worked together so that we can each explain our pieces to each other.
