# See The Whole

## Week 1
Seeing the whole is all about having the team recognize the big picture. Being able to work on small parts, yet realizing the value of that part to the rest of the project, is an essential skill for everyone on the team to have. Since we haven't written any code or implemented any design yet, it is much easier to see the whole.

We started with splitting up the research, each looking into a few libraries and tools required for the project, then coming together to discuss the pros and cons of each. This will allow us to discuss which tools we'd like to use, and the impact a choice of one particular tool can have on our product. This approach is inline with this value as it allows us to see the various choices we have.

Another example of us seeing the whole is our dedication to the Agile process. The focus of this assignment is to practice Agile and Design Patterns. We've spent alot of time this week discussing and agreeing on the workflow that we will use.

## Week 2
This week, we battled with ideas discussed and details about the project. Our discussions focused on what would be included in the game, what languages, frameworks, and tools we would use for the project. More importantly, we focused on how each choice would effect the long term. We elaborated on our ideas and determined the estimated time and effort it would take to implement each idea. Overall, we did a good job at seeing the whole while putting a magnifying glass on the project.
