# Core Values: Feedback
## Week 1

* One of the most important values of XP is Feedback. We constantly take feedback from the teammates and change our work based on the feedback we receive. For the first week, we started to discuss project ideas and write down tasks. We took the feedback after discussion and changed the game ideas. We also changed the form and requirements for the task cards. 

* After making changes based on the feedback, now our task cards are more specific and easier to read. We will take more feedback next week after doing more research on the tools we need to develop the game.

## Week 2

* In this week, we had a meeting about game engines and game ideas. We constantly take feedback to change the plan of our project. We started with choosing which game engine to use. We took feedback from everyone's research and study, and then we decided to go with phaser and javascript. 
* Then we voted and picked the idea of a coding game. After a discussion, everyone thinks we should pair it with a rescuing game. From there, we talked about the game logic, view of the game, and levels of the game. We started with side-scrolling view, then we discussed and changed to top down view. When we were trying to figure out each level of the game, we also discussed and then made modifications of the level design. 

## Week 3
* Last week, we had a virtual meeting since the team has different schedule and it was difficult to meet on campus at one time. So we took feed back from the team and decided to hold a virtual meeting. We will take feed back next week from the virtual meeting we had and decide if we should continue this type of meeting or switch back to in person meeting.
* We also discussed our progress so far, the team find it difficult to build games in phaser to achieve a desired effect, so we decide to take more time in learning from the tutorials and how to design the architecture. 
* We are still constantly taking feedback in many ways.

## Week 4

* Last two weeks, we were thinking about how to design the details of the game and how to implement them. Everyone started working on the game so we were able to give each other feedbacks on how the game should be. We take each other's feedback and decided to choose a room and desert map for our game, and the main character's movements, as well as the user interface of the entire game.
* We also discussed about the design patterns and coding maintainability of our project, after getting feedback from more experienced developers, we learned how to write more reusable code in the future. 
* Taking feedback is very important in working as a team, we can constantly learn from each other and we improve faster than working individually.

## Week 5
* Last week, we started working on creating game levels, we started with just loading an image as our world map. Then we discussed and decided that it will make more sense if we create different layers for the map of each level, so that we can handle collision more easily.
* We also take feedback for the person's progress and we changed the reponsibilites of our task assignment because some of the work are harder than others thus we need more people working on it.
