# Core Values: Feedback
## Week 1

* One of the most important values of XP is Feedback. We constantly take feedback from the teammates and change our work based on the feedback we receive. For the first week, we started to discuss project ideas and write down tasks. We took the feedback after discussion and changed the game ideas. We also changed the form and requirements for the task cards. 

* After making changes based on the feedback, now our task cards are more specific and easier to read. We will take more feedback next week after doing more research on the tools we need to develop the game.
