# Core Values: Feedback
## Week 1

* One of the most important values of XP is Feedback. We constantly take feedback from the teammates and change our work based on the feedback we receive. For the first week, we started to discuss project ideas and write down tasks. We took the feedback after discussion and changed the game ideas. We also changed the form and requirements for the task cards. 

* After making changes based on the feedback, now our task cards are more specific and easier to read. We will take more feedback next week after doing more research on the tools we need to develop the game.

## Week 2

* In this week, we had a meeting about game engines and game ideas. We constantly take feedback to change the plan of our project. We started with choosing which game engine to use. We took feedback from everyone's research and study, and then we decided to go with phaser and javascript. 
* Then we voted and picked the idea of a coding game. After a discussion, everyone thinks we should pair it with a rescuing game. From there, we talked about the game logic, view of the game, and levels of the game. We started with side-scrolling view, then we discussed and changed to top down view. When we were trying to figure out each level of the game, we also discussed and then made modifications of the level design.
