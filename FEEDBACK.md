# Core Values: Feedback
## Week 1

* One of the most important values of XP is Feedback. We constantly take feedback from the teammates and change our work based on the feedback we receive. For the first week, we started to discuss project ideas and write down tasks. We took the feedback after discussion and changed the game ideas. We also changed the form and requirements for the task cards. 

* After making changes based on the feedback, now our task cards are more specific and easier to read. We will take more feedback next week after doing more research on the tools we need to develop the game.

## Week 2

* In this week, we had a meeting about game engines and game ideas. We constantly take feedback to change the plan of our project. We started with choosing which game engine to use. We took feedback from everyone's research and study, and then we decided to go with phaser and javascript. 
* Then we voted and picked the idea of a coding game. After a discussion, everyone thinks we should pair it with a rescuing game. From there, we talked about the game logic, view of the game, and levels of the game. We started with side-scrolling view, then we discussed and changed to top down view. When we were trying to figure out each level of the game, we also discussed and then made modifications of the level design. 

## Week 3
* Last week, we had a virtual meeting since the team has different schedule and it was difficult to meet on campus at one time. So we took feed back from the team and decided to hold a virtual meeting. We will take feed back next week from the virtual meeting we had and decide if we should continue this type of meeting or switch back to in person meeting.
* We also discussed our progress so far, the team find it difficult to build games in phaser to achieve a desired effect, so we decide to take more time in learning from the tutorials and how to design the architecture. 
* We are still constantly taking feedback in many ways.

## Week 4

* Last two weeks, we were thinking about how to design the details of the game and how to implement them. Everyone started working on the game so we were able to give each other feedbacks on how the game should be. We take each other's feedback and decided to choose a room and desert map for our game, and the main character's movements, as well as the user interface of the entire game.
* We also discussed about the design patterns and coding maintainability of our project, after getting feedback from more experienced developers, we learned how to write more reusable code in the future. 
* Taking feedback is very important in working as a team, we can constantly learn from each other and we improve faster than working individually.

## Week 5
* Last week, we started working on creating game levels, we started with just loading an image as our world map. Then we discussed and decided that it will make more sense if we create different layers for the map of each level, so that we can handle collision more easily.

* We also take feedback for all of our teammates' progress and we adjusted the reponsibilites of our task assignment because some of the work are harder than others thus we need more people working on it.

## Week 6
*  Since this week we started to integrate our game, in order to make the process more productive, high level of feedback was paramount. We took feedback from every teammate to make sure we are all on the same page, not facing any major blockages. 

*  One of the team member designed the class diagram, so we discussed about the diagram and assigned our tasks based on our current knowledge of phaser, and make sure every one is doing what they are familiar with. 

*  Our tile map had a problem because we are using three different csv files for all the levels. After discussing and researching, we decided that we should only include one csv file. In the future, we will change our map design and make it easier for other teammates to use.  

## Week 7
*  We had a meeting when we sat together and merged our code together. We helped each other, some developers with more experience on a certain area help other developers who are less experienced in that area. That way we got things done much faster than working alone. It seemed to be an efficient way for us to make progress in the project. We will take this method in the future when we need help from others.

*  We also discussed that, whenever we want to push code to the master branch, we should first create a new branch and commit the code there, that way, we can request other teammates to review and approve. Once it is approved, only then we merge to master branch. By doing this, we will not have issues caused by changing our codes by mistake, or bringing unnecessary bugs to our project. We discussed and tried this method in the meeting, it worked well and we decided to adopt this method in the future for our project.  

* Taking feedback in the above ways really help us forming an organized and professional way in developing as a team.
