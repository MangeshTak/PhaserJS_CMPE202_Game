# XP Core Value - Respect

### Week #1
* One of the most important value in XP is Respect. An effective approach is to assume that everyone involved with our project has equal value and therefore should be treated with respect.
* We have a unique team with people having different cultural backgrounds and we respect each others opinions.
* We respect diversity.
* We have also divided different topics to be researched on, among ourselves because everyone's opinion and knowledge matters.

### Week #2
* In the second week, we all came up with our own game idea to discuss. We all presented our idea and gave a walkthrough.
* Everyone's feedback was taken, be it negative or positive.
* Since everyone's opinion matters and we respect each others way of thinking, we decided on one game to move forward with.

### Week #3
* In the third week, we assigned different modules to each other to do research on.
* Modules like Character designing, Music implementation, UI development etc. were researched on and discussed.
* Since we all respect the responsibilities given to us, we are committed to our work and try our best to finish it on time.

### Week #4
* In the fourth week, we divided different modules among ourselves like UI, Character, Maps, Sound etc.
* development on different modules is started.

### Week #5
* We divided tasks to create maps for our 2D game.
* We learnt how to import maps in the game and interact with different objects on the map.

### Week #6
* We are integrating our work into single project.
* We are defining our start point and end game strategies.

### Week #7
* In the final few weeks, we are integrating our codes in the final project area.
* We are working on different branches to avoid conflicting codes and hampering others codes.
