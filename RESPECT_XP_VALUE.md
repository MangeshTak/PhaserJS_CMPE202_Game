# XP Core Value - Respect

### Week #1
* One of the most important value in XP is Respect. An effective approach is to assume that everyone involved with our project has equal value and therefore should be treated with respect.
* We have a unique team with people having different cultural backgrounds and we respect each others opinions.
* We respect diversity.
* We have also divided different topics to be researched on, among ourselves because everyone's opinion and knowledge matters.
